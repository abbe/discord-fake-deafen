# Discord Fake Deafen / Mute
This script allows you to fake deafen/mute in voice chat

# How to use
Ctrl + Shift + I and go to "Console" tab 
Mute/deafen your discord before executing anything (important)
Paste in code and execute the code.js
Unmute and undeafen, you'll now be able to talk normally, while others will see you as muted and/or deafened
To get back to normal, first disconnect from the VC - then press CTRL+R and once discord restarts you are good to go.
