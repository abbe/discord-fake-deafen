# Discord Fake Deafen / Mute
This script allows you to fake deafen/mute in voice chat

# How to use
Ctrl + Shift + I and go to "Console" tab <br />
Mute/deafen your discord before executing anything (important) <br />
Paste in code and execute the code.js <br />
Unmute and undeafen, you'll now be able to talk normally, while others will see you as muted and/or deafened <br />
To get back to normal, first disconnect from the VC - then press CTRL+R and once discord restarts you are good to go,
